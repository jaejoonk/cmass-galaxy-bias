# cmass-galaxy-bias

Final project for PHYS5533 Fall23.

- `cmass-map.ipynb`: Compute galaxy overdensity map from the catalog
- `cmass-compute-clgg.ipynb`: Compute galaxy auto-spectrum from overdensity map, compare with theory
- `cmass-cobaya.ipynb`: Run cobaya using data measurement + covariance with CAMB theory
- `cmass-galaxy-sims.ipynb`: Generate full sky galaxy simulations to compute sim-based covariance (outdated)
